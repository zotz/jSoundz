jSoundz - a jack audio SoundWall.
---------------------------------

This is the README file for jSoundz, a jack SoundWall application.

Currently, jSoundz has no jack abilities but rather uses sox to play sound files
from disk.

Hopefully, jack abilities will be added soon.

Homepage: http://github.com/zotz/jSoundz/wiki

License: GNU General Public License (GPL)

See the LICENSE file.

Currently version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

I am thinking of taking it to version 3 or perhaps the agpl soon, so keep an eye
out if this will bother you.

Requirements
------------

QT4

sox

Installation
------------

qmake -project
qmake
make

I have a lot to learn. Help and guidance appreciated.

Configuration
-------------

Currently, jSoundz stores some config data in jsoundz.cfg or other config files
that you may create.

Currently of interest are:

doplayer mplayer
jackout in_

You can edit the file in a text editor. be careful not to change the other stuff
in the file.

Currently acceptable values for doplayer are:

doplayer sox
doplayer mplayer

Setting doplayer to sox will result in playing the sounds via whatever sox plays
through on your system.

Setting doplayer to mplayer will result in playing the sounds via jack. Be sure
to start jack first before running jSoundz if you set doplayer to mplayer.

It will connect to the first two ports matching the jackout value. For instance,
on my system I would put:

jackout in_

to connect to a LiveMix instance or:

jackout playback

to connect to system playback.

I think that either mplayer is a bit lacking in specifying these ports or my
understanding of how to do the right thing is lacking. It would not surprise me
if it is the latter. If you can clue me in, I would appreciate it.

I don't like the behaviour this exibits as the connections are made and broken
on each play.

When I figure out how to do this right, I will connect up once (perhaps not at
all) and maintain the connectoin for the duration.

Seriously, too may to guess at right now.
