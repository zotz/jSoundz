jSoundz - a jack audio SoundWall.
---------------------------------

This is the README file for jSoundz, a jack SoundWall application.

Currently, jSoundz has no jack abilities but rather uses sox to play sound files
from disk.

Hopefully, jack abilities will be added soon.

Currently version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

I am thinking of taking it to version 3 or perhaps the agpl soon, so keep an eye
out if this will bother you.
